**Hint** is an *extension* for the [Adapt framework](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework).

The extension appends a button to any component. On selecting the button, additional content is displayed in a popup. The button can contain either text and/or icon and can be configured per component.

The intended use is a 'hint' for question components, providing additional content to aid answering a question. Or, to provide 'more info' for presentation components. Whether to declutter text heavy content, or, group content of a particular type/theme.

The hint button is displayed between the component display text (header) and the interaction (widget). For components without display text, the button is displayed after the interaction (widget).

## Installation

Open the */src/extensions* folder in a new terminal window on Mac OSX or right click the folder and select 'Git Bash Here' on Windows.

Git clone the component, making sure to delete the hidden **.git** folder from the *adapt-hint* folder.

## Settings Overview

The attributes listed below are used in *components.json* to configure **Hint**, and are properly formatted as JSON in [*example.json*](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-hint/blob/master/example.json).

## Attributes

>**\_isEnabled** (boolean): Turns **Hint** on and off. Acceptable values are `true` and `false`.

>**title** (string): The title displayed in the popup.

>**altTitle** (string): This will be read out by screen readers as an alternative title if no visual **title** is included.

>**body** (string): The body text displayed in the popup.

>**\_imageAlignment** (string):
Defines the alignment of the popup image. Left: Image aligned to the left of the text area. Top: Image aligned above the text area. Right: Image aligned to the right of the text area. Bottom: Image aligned below the text area. The default alignment is `right`.

>**\_graphic** (object):
The image displayed in the popup. It contains the following settings:

>>**\_src** (string):
File name (including path) of the image. Path should be relative to the `src` folder (e.g. `"course/en/images/origami-menu-two.jpg"`).

>>**alt** (string):
The alternative text for this image. Assign [alt text](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Providing-good-alt-text) to images that convey course content only.

>>**attribution** (string):
Optional text to be displayed as an [attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Best_practices_for_attribution). By default it is displayed below the image. Adjust positioning by modifying CSS. Text can contain HTML tags, e.g., `Copyright Â© 2015 by <b>Lukasz 'Severiaan' Grela</b>`.

>**\_button** (object): The **Hint** button contains values for **\_iconClass**, **\_alignIconRight**, **text** and **ariaLabel**.

>>**\_iconClass** (string): CSS class name to be applied to the `button` icon. The class must be predefined in one of the Less files with the corresponding icon added as part of a font. See list of available [_vanilla_ icons](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-vanilla/wiki/Icons) to choose from. Default is `icon-question`.

>>**\_alignIconright** (boolean): Defines whether the icon is aligned to the left or right of the text (if applicable). Default is `true`, which aligns the icon to the right of the text.

>>**text** (string): The text that displays in the `button`.

>>**ariaLabel** (string): This will be read out by screen readers as alternative text if no visual button text is included.

## Accessibility

A global **Hint** button `aria-label` can be set within the `_globals._extensions._hint.openButtonText` object in **course.json** (or Project settings > Globals in the Adapt Authoring Tool). Default is `Open hint`. This will be overridden when setting either **text** or **ariaLabel** on the component's model in *components.json*.

## Limitations

No known limitations.
